Credit card fraud detection is a machine learning project focused on identifying fraudulent transactions from a large set of financial transaction data. The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions.

In this project, the dataset is highly imbalanced, where fraudulent transactions represent a very small percentage of total transactions. To handle this, appropriate data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and class imbalance handling (SMOTE / undersampling) are applied.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand transaction patterns, fraud distribution, and feature behavior. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained and evaluated.

Model performance is measured using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, with special emphasis on Recall, as correctly identifying fraudulent transactions is critical in real-world financial systems.

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the financial domain and highlights the importance of handling imbalanced data, feature engineering, and model evaluation for real-world fraud detection systems.
